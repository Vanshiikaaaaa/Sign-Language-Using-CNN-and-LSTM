# ✨ Sign Language Recognition System (LSTM + MediaPipe)

This project is a real-time sign language recognition system that uses a webcam to detect and classify hand and body gestures into predefined phrases such as "hi how are you" and "thank you so much". It leverages MediaPipe for landmark detection (face, pose, and hands) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to learn and predict gesture sequences over time.

Key features include:

-Real-time gesture capture using OpenCV and MediaPipe

-Sequence classification using an LSTM-based neural network

-Evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix

-Live webcam inference and overlay of predicted text

-Modular and extensible for more gesture classes

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Prepare Data:**

   Ensure your directory follows this format:
   ```
   MP_Data/
   ├── hi how are you/
   │   ├── 0/
   │   │   ├── 0.npy
   │   │   ├── ...
   ├── thank you so much/
   ```

2. **Train the Model:**

   Run the script to train:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Real-time Inference:**

   After training, the webcam feed will start. Perform gestures in front of your camera.

   Press `q` to quit.
